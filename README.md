# SIMP
This is a Github reporsitory for `SIMP`, the Bayesian simultaneous partial envelope model. Based on the simultaneous envelope and the partial response envelope models, 
this proposed model addresses some limitations of these two advanced models, and provides a more efficient estimator for the regression coefficients in the multivariate
linear regression model, and improves prediction for the multivariate responses. See details in the manuscript of (Shen et al.)
