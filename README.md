# SIMP
This is a Github reporsitory for `SIMP`, the Bayesian simultaneous partial envelope model. Based on the simultaneous envelope and the partial response envelope models, 
this proposed model addresses some limitations of these two advanced envelope models by partitioning the predictors of interest into continuous and categorical parts. It also provides a more efficient estimator for the regression coefficients in the multivariate
linear regression model, and improves prediction for the multivariate responses. See details in the manuscript of (Shen et al.)

## Install `SIMP` R package:
